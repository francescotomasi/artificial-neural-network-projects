This repository contains two artificial neural network projects:

1. **Blood Cell Image Classification**  
   - Multi-class classification problem involving 96x96 RGB images of blood cells.  

2. **Mars Terrain Segmentation**  
   - Semantic segmentation task involving 64x128 grayscale images of Mars terrain, with 5 terrain classes:  
     - 0: Background  
     - 1: Soil  
     - 2: Bedrock  
     - 3: Sand
